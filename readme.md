# castepio

An io library for associated castep files.

This package aims to provide fast, robust, and useful io support for castep files. Rather than scrape large output files for the bare minimuim, the goal with this package is to completely parse the files according to their apparent grammar. This would provide an object with the complete information contained in the parsed file.
